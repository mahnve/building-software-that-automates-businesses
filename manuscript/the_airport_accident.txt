My personal favorite exception to processes happened a few years back. It's
early morning, and I am at the airport about to fly to Paris. I had used the
check-in machines and tagged my own bag, and as I left my bag at the bag drop, I
managed to put my boarding pass in the bag. I did not realize my mistake until
the bag was well on its way down the conveyor belt. As you know, there was no
way for me to get on the plane without a boarding card, but also, the plane
can't leave without me with my bag on board, due to the obvious threat owner
less bags are at an airplane.

With mixture of embarrassment and panic I asked the lady manning the desk what I
should do, and she told me to go see some Anders around the corner. I do just
that, and Anders turns out to be some sort of security manager, and I again
explain to him that I managed to check in my boarding card. I am really not sure
what to expect at this point.

What happens next is that Anders is able to sort the whole thing out. He brings
me to an elevator, tells the security guard outside "He's with me", and we go
down to the sorting room to find my bag and get my boarding card. Way less
complicated than I thought it would be.

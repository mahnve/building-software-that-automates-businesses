Perhaps you haven't been there yourself, perhaps you're just upset
that IT can't deliver stuff on time. You really should do something
about that department.

This book tries to explain how software development works, what it is
and what it isn't. It will teach you a bit of history to show you why
we organize companies the way we do.

This is not a technical book at all. I will not teach you
_programming_, as in how to write code for the computer. Not everyone
in involved in with software business automation needs to know how to
program, however much I happen to love programming. It's really a lot
of fun.

But I will tell you how the process of _software development_ works,
meaning everything leading up to and around the actual programming. If
you are part of business automation, it is my strong opinion that you
need to understand this, or be confident enough to delegate decisions
to someone who does.

Hope you enjoy it. If you have any questions or comments, please

Few people these days have reason to build their own email server, or their
own accounting system. Building software is expensive, so it is normally well
spent money to buy an accounting system.

Because there is a world of difference between automating stuff that you do just
like everybody else, and the stuff that is uniquely yours. As stated earlier,
for non-unique stuff you can buy stuff of the shelf, or use open source. This is
the field of email, accounting, word processors, file storage, web servers. You
don't build it, you use what's already there.

But for stuff that's yours, you _can't_ buy stuff off the shelf. Don't believe
the people who say you can. There are a lot of software vendors out there who
claim that you only need to "configure" their software, and that's somehow
different to programming. As I said, don't believe them.

You will _always_ need to program software in order to automate processes that
are uniquely yours. And this is normally when the problem starts. Which is what
this book is all about.

There might be a economic advantage to building your own software, but before
you do you need to know how to do it.

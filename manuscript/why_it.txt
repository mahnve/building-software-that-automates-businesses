# Why Do We Have IT?

Every company has an IT department. Computers have become so ubiquitous, that we
do need to remind ourselves why we use them. We use computers to control car
engines and nuclear power plants, we use them to play games, edit photos.


## Why Computers?

Computers are good at basically four things:

* Calculations
* Remembering things
* Talking to other computers

We used to have office workers, sometimes floor upon floor of them, doing manual
calculations. These are now done by more correctly and way faster by computers.

Pictures of old offices shows row upon row of office clerks, all doing
repetitive tasks of handling incoming payment slips, calculating monthly reports
etc. These tasks have also been automated using software.


### Remembering Things

Computers are really good at remembering things, and finding them fast. 

We used to have all our information on paper. When I was a kid and wanted to
find a book in the library, I went to this specially made cupboard, which held
an individual card for every book in the library. This was of course the analog
version of a database. Addresses were written down on paper and stored in
Rolodex's, another paper database. As of this writing, Amazon is still selling
them, so I guess there are people still using them.

Many people still have encyclopedias in their homes, but these days they are
seldom used. With the internet at hand, why settle for a slower and most
probably out of date alternative?


### Talking To Other Computers.

At my first job at IBM, we were still using internal, physical, mail. You would
put paper in a special envelope, and then we had this internal postal office
which made sure they were delivered to its intended recipient. We now have email
automating this process which just happened to also automate what you used to
pay the Postal Service to do.

## Automating Processes

Given the above examples, we can start to see that the business world uses
computers to automate manual processes. While this may seem like an obvious
observation, it is something that we tend to forget, because we've become so
used to doing it.

Pretty much like the factory before it, the office has automated repetitive,
menial tasks. If you've ever uttered the phrase "a machine could do this",
chances are it could. Where manual repetitive tasks were automated in the
factory, repetitive thought processes have been and continues to be automated.

The processes mentioned above were the first to be automated, and are processes
that are pretty much the same wherever you are. People don't really differ that
much when it comes to accounting, and those who do are seldom looked upon
favorable by law enforcement agencies.

For these kind of processes there is existing software, commercial or open
source, that does what you want to do.

But then we have the processes where you don't do things like everybody
else. This is the stuff that defines your company, your unique selling point and
what sets you apart. Some of these processes are repetitive, and can be
automated. And how this is done is what this book is all about.

# What Are Computers Bad At?

Computers are powerful and ubiquitous enough to have become the proverbial
hammer and most every problem in the business looks like a nail. There is
basically no problem conceivable that can't be solved by throwing a relational
database and a web site backed by your standard vendor content management system
at it.

But computers are actually really bad at a lot of things. They are terrible at
making impromptu workarounds and exceptions to rules. And is it turns out, there
are a lot of those around.

Your old manual expense routine might have required people to hand in receipts
by the end of the month, but the nice people at the economics department
normally could handle the occasional late entry if asked nicely. Your new
automated routine has no such feature, which will leave people in your
organization thinking that the new system is worse than the old one.

The point here is that there are no written rules on how to handle this. An
airport, much like a large company, has a lot of rules to describe what people
should do in a multitude of scenarios. But you will always have a customer that
manages to do something that you haven't thought of, and for that you have
people to handle it. As soon as you automate it, you lose a lot of capability,
instead creating the need for a large support organization.

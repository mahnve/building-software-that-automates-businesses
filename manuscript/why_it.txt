# Why Do We Have IT?

Computers have become so ubiquitous, that we do need to remind
ourselves why we use them. We use computers to control car engines and
nuclear power plants, we use them to play games, edit photos.

In the business world we use computers to automate manual
processes. That is something that we tend to forget, because we've
become so used to doing it. Everyone has email, but what it does is
automate the sending of letters. We used to have, and I hear some
still have, internal mail, where you put paper in envelopes, and you
had actual people carrying them around delivering them to its intended
recipient.
